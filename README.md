# Personal Profile in Political Economy through History


## UX

The purpose of this project is to create a static (front-end) website. I would like to show my audience the living standart of the Ancient Rome.
This Rome what we know as a great empire today. Having said that, as we know now, Roman empire does not exist enymore. It is because during this time
we had a good time and bad time. The good time was when the Rome was growing and centralized his power in capital city Rome. And bad time when Rome 
could not take a deep breath and had got to big problems likewise corruption, economic crissis and problems on the borders starting from third Century A.C..
For good objectivity I will try to describe my topic in economy which was affected by trade and in politics which I will put in attention a citizenship
in Rome and how was citizenship affecting the stability or instability of entire empire in terms of work, military.
